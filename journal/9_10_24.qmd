## Notes

-   a frame: variables/features that define the axes of the canvas

-   a layer: geometric elements added to the canvas to represent data points/patterns (e.g. lines, points)

    -   sometimes called "geoms"/"glyphs" (like *hieroglyph*)

-   scales: aesthetics added to geom elements (e.g. color, shape)

-   faceting: splitting up of data into subplots/facets to examine groups w/in the data

-   a theme: controls of finer points of plot aesthetics (e.g. font type, background, etc)

"gg"="grammar of graphics"--e.g. "ggplot"
