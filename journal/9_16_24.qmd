## Notes

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# Import data
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  

# Check out the first 6 rows
# What are the units of observation?
# humidity, rain levels, rainbow, temperature, pressure, etc

# How many data points do we have? 
# 2367

# What type of variables do we have?
# categorical and numerical
```

# Plot to examine temp3pm
```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm))+geom_histogram()
```

# Afternoon temp by location

```{r}
# Plot 1 (no facets & starting from a density plot of temp3pm)
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm)) + 
  geom_density()
```

## Location = only Wollongong
```{r}
woll <- weather %>%
  filter(location == "Wollongong") %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  

# How often does it raintoday?
# Fill your geometric layer with the color blue.
ggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday))+geom_bar(fill = "lightblue")

# Now compare different approaches

# Default: stacked bars
ggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + 
  geom_bar()

# Side-by-side bars
ggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

# Proportional bars
# position = "fill" refers to filling the frame, nothing to do with the color-related fill
ggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

## Example 4
```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date))+geom_line()
```
## Example 5
```{r}
# Plot temp3pm vs temp9am
# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am)) + 
  geom_point("Hobart" = "lightblue", "Uluru" = "lightgreen", "Wollongong" = "lightyellow")
```



## Questions

# For Example 2, ch.5 --what does it mean when it asks us to plot w/ or w/o "facets" or "densities"?

# How do we do example 5?
