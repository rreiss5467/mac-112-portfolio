df1 %>% 
  left_join(df2)
combines two datasets into one table--4 columns into 3
  - prioritizes left one (df1)

df1 %>% 
  inner_join(df2)
combines two datasets into one table
  - prioritizes right one (df2)

df1 %>% 
  full_join(df2)
combines two datasets into one table
  - prioritizes both equally
  
semi_join()
- only prioritizes the vars in common between datasets

anti_join()
- prioritizes the vars included exclusively in df1
